🧠 AWS Generative AI Lab — Theo7 Portfolio Project

This repo documents my hands-on completion of the AWS Skill Builder Lab: “Build a Generative AI App with SageMaker”.

💡 Goal: Deploy a "LangChain + Falcon Foundation Model" app on Amazon SageMaker, connect it to AWS Lambda, and enable API Gateway access — creating a secure generative AI pipeline.

This was more than a copy-paste lab. I documented errors, code edits, and sandbox limitations so others can replicate or debug the lab. This is part of my real-world AWS portfolio.
